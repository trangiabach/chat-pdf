## Architecture ‚öôÔ∏è

ChatPDF is partitioned into the following:
- **Client/Frontend Framework**: Next.js (React), TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Components Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Server/Backend Frameworks**: ChatPDF uses [Next.js serverless API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes), which creates API endpoints as Node.js serverless functions. These functions are defined under `app/api/*`
- **Storage**: A bucket to store PDF files using [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage)
- **Vector Store**: A vector store to  store embeddings of PDF files (for RAG) using [Supabase pgvector]
- **LLM Interface**: Uses Langchain to interface with multiple LLMs and create RAG features efficiently
- **LLM UI**: Uses [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) to handle streaming and state management in the UI efficiently
